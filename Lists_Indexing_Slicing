#Changing lists
#Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".

#One way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.

#For example, let's say we want to rename Mars:

planets[3] = 'Malacandra'
planets
['Mercury',
 'Venus',
 'Earth',
 'Malacandra',
 'Jupiter',
 'Saturn',
 'Uranus',
 'Neptune']
 
#Interlude: objects
#I've used the term 'object' a lot so far - you may have even read that everything in Python is an object. What does that mean?

#In short, objects carry some things around with them. You access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.

#For example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called imag representing their imaginary part. 
#(You'll probably never need to use this unless you're doing some very weird math.)

x = 12
# x is a real number, so its imaginary part is 0.
print(x.imag)
# Here's how to make a complex number, in case you've ever been curious:
c = 12 + 3j
print(c.imag)
#OUTPUT
#0
#3.0

#list.pop removes and returns the last element of a list:

planets.pop()

#Tuples
#Tuples are almost exactly the same as lists. They differ in just two ways.

#1: The syntax for creating them uses parentheses instead of square brackets
t = (1, 2, 3)
t
#(1, 2, 3)

#2: They cannot be modified (they are immutable).

t[0] = 100

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
#<ipython-input-36-e6cf7836e708> in <module>
#----> 1 t[0] = 100

#TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

#Tuples are often used for functions that have multiple return values.

#For example, the as_integer_ratio() method of float objects returns a numerator and a denominator in the form of a tuple:

x = 0.125
x.as_integer_ratio()
#OUTPUT (1, 8)
