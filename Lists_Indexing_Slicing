#Changing lists
#Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".

#One way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.

#For example, let's say we want to rename Mars:

planets[3] = 'Malacandra'

#Interlude: objects
#I've used the term 'object' a lot so far - you may have even read that everything in Python is an object. What does that mean?

#In short, objects carry some things around with them. You access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.

#For example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called imag representing their imaginary part. (You'll probably never need to use this unless you're doing some very weird math.)

x = 12
# x is a real number, so its imaginary part is 0.
print(x.imag)
# Here's how to make a complex number, in case you've ever been curious:
c = 12 + 3j
print(c.imag)
#OUTPUT
#0
#3.0
