#The for loop specifies

#the variable name to use (in this case, planet)
#the set of values to loop over (in this case, planets)
#You use the word "in" to link them together.

#The object to the right of the "in" can be any object that supports iteration. Basically, if it can be thought of as a group of things, you can probably loop over it. In addition to lists, we can iterate over the elements of a tuple:

multiplicands = (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5)
product = 2
for mult in multiplicands:
    product = product * mult
product
#OUTPUT 720
s = 'steganograpHy is the practicE of conceaLing a file, message, image, or video within another fiLe, message, image, Or video.'
msg = ''
# print all the uppercase letters in s, one at a time
for char in s:
    if char.isupper():
        print(char, end='')
#OUTPUT HELLO

for i in range(5):
    print("Doing important work. i =", i)
