# Python_Data_Science
Data Scientist Career start code

This is code I've gathered partially from Kaggle and also from a Udemy Data Science Bootcamp plus some of my own I've created. 

The intent is for me and others interested to review basics and intermediate Python code from this specific consolidated repository if needed.
