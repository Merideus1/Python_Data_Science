#Operation	Description		Operation	Description
#a == b	a equal to b		a != b	a not equal to b
#a < b	a less than b		a > b	a greater than b
#a <= b	a less than or equal to b		a >= b	a greater than or equal to b

#Comparison operators can be combined with the arithmetic operators we've already seen to express a virtually limitless range of mathematical tests. 
#For example, we can check if a number is odd by checking that the modulus with 2 returns 1:
def is_odd(n):
    return (n % 2) == 1

print("Is 100 odd?", is_odd(100))
print("Is -1 odd?", is_odd(-1))
#OUTPUT 
#Is 100 odd? False
#Is -1 odd? True

#Remember to use == instead of = when making comparisons. If you write n == 3 you are asking about the value of n. When you write n = 3 you are changing the value of n.
