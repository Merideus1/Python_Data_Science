# When plotting, we call shap_values[1]. For classification problems, there is a separate array of SHAP values for each possible outcome. 
# In this case, we index in to get the SHAP values for the prediction of "True".

# Calculating SHAP values can be slow. It isn't a problem here, because this dataset is small. But you'll want to be careful when running 
# these to plot with reasonably sized datasets. The exception is when using an xgboost model, which SHAP has some optimizations for and which is thus much faster.
